## Project 1
Background:

Someday, we’ll be able to go to restaurants to dine again. But to be Covid-safe, we need to make sure that the number of diners in a restaurant does not exceed its permitted capacity.

Imagine you are writing the software to manage the bookings at a restaurant. How do you fit in as many bookings as possible without exceeding the capacity limit? In this project you will write Python functions to do exactly this, using a number of strategies described.

Question 1: pick bookings in increasing order of size until you can’t add any more bookings without exceeding the restaurant capacity.

Question 2: pick bookings in decreasing order of size until you can’t add any more bookings without exceeding the restaurant capacity.

Question 3: try all combinations of bookings, and find the combination that has the most diners without exceeding the restaurant capacity.

Question 4: maximise the total revenue of the restaurant from the accepted bookings, while not exceeding the permitted capacity.

## Project 2
Background:

Autonomous vehicles (self-driving cars) need to follow a path to navigate to their destination. We need to predict what the location of the vehicle will be after following navigation instructions.

The autonomous vehicle navigates through a grid of cells and the vehicle can drive in one of four directions: N, S, E, W.

Navigation: The location of the vehicle is described by (x, y, direction).

Each “program” is a list of actions corresponding to the actions of the vehicle e.g. [‘Drive’, ‘TurnR’, ‘Drive’]

Our aim is to write an interpreter for our language, which can determine the final location of the vehicle after executing a given program.

We will define and implement a very simple programming language for navigating a simple autonomous vehicle

Question 1: Simple programs for navigation

Question 2: Checking for collisions

Question 3: Calculating tolls

Question 4: Programs using iteration
